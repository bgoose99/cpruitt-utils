# ChatterBox #

ChatterBox is a simple desktop IM (instant messaging) client written in Java that works over a single multicast address. Although there are many IM clients already out there, I had access to none while working on a closed system. Because many of the developers on the program were not co-located, I wanted a way to communicate quickly, and came up with a very simple app to pass messages back and forth.
