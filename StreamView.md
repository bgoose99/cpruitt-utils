# StreamView #

StreamView is a simple Java application that allows the user to open a file and view the data within as a series of bytes, each broken down into bits. The user can highlight one or more bits.

StreamView is just a proof-of-concept written to explore the idea of displaying and manipulating individual bits within a stream; in this case, a file.
